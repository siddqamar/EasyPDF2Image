## Introduction

**EasyPDF2Image** is a simple Python script that converts PDF files into image formats like PNG or JPEG. This tool makes it easy to turn each page of a PDF into separate image files, which can be useful for presentations, sharing, or archiving.

## Motivation

I created **EasyPDF2Image** to help my colleague who was manually converting PDF files to images by taking screenshots of each page. This method was time-consuming and not very efficient. Additionally, my colleague did not want to upload sensitive PDF files to online services because of confidentiality concerns.

To solve these problems, I developed this script to allow secure and quick conversion of PDF files to images directly on a local computer. This way, all files remain safe and private.
